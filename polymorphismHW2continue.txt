After you created all the relevant car classes (polymorphismHW2.png)

1)
In the main method create instances (objects) for all subclasses of "Car" 

2)
create an ArrayList of type Car

3)
Add all instances to the array list

4)
loop through Arraylist and call overrided methods of the instances inside the loop to see polymorphism in action!!

**Bonus**
Change Car class to be abstract class. 
Change some of the methods to be abstract methods.

Check that everything is still work as expected
